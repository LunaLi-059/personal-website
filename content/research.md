### Technological Interdependence and National Security-Related Investment Restrictions: Firm-Level Evidence of CFIUS Reviews
What explains the rise in national security-related investment restrictions and why
are high-tech firms disproportionally targeted? I argue that national security-based 
investment restrictions serve two goals of governments: (1) to prevent technology diffusion to their
geopolitical rivals, and (2) to enhance their regulatory influence over high-tech firms that are
not effectively regulated by traditional industrial policies. I hypothesize that governments are
more likely to invoke national security when their domestic firms control chokepoints, i.e., key
technologies, in global innovation networks (GINs), and when governments lack regulatory
control of these firms. I test this hypothesis by compiling an original dataset of 700 CFIUS
reviews and conducting network analysis of US firms' positions in GINs using 188k patent
license and assignment agreements involving Chinese and US firms from 2000 to 2021. The
results show that compared to peripheral firms in GINs, those controlling key technologies are
48% more likely to face CFIUS reviews. Furthermore, firms weakly regulated by the government are 
8% more likely to be reviewed by CFIUS compared to those with median exposure to
government regulations. Firms' central positions in global innovation networks paradoxically
incentivize governments to restrict their access to foreign capital, contrary to the conventional
wisdom that technological interdependence leads to investment liberalization.


### How Political Tensions Fuel Cross-border Investment: American Consumer Hostility and Mergers and Acquisitions by Chinese and Japanese Firms, with Megumi Naoi
This paper leverages firm-level data on Japanese and Chinese mergers and acquisitions
(M&As) in the United States spanning over three decades to demonstrate that political
tensions between two countries increase cross-border mergers and acquisitions, contrary
to the conventional wisdom that political tensions reduce cross-border investment.
We develop and test a consumer-driven mechanism, whereby the rise of American
consumer hostility toward Chinese (since 2016) and Japanese products (in the 1980s)
in the United States incentivizes Chinese (Japanese) companies to engage in mergers
and acquisitions with American firms to make their national identity less visible to
consumers. We find that Chinese firms producing final consumer goods and Japanese
firms producing final goods for corporations in global supply chains are more likely to
increase mergers and acquisitions with U.S. companies compared to comparable firms
that are producing intermediate goods. Profit-seeking firms have a repertoire of tools
to address changing consumer preferences abroad and therefore political tensions can
fuel, rather than dampen, globalization.

### The Geopolitical Consequences of COVID-19: Assessing Hawkish Mass Opinion in China, with Joshua Byun and D.G. Kim, *Political Science Quarterly*, Vol.136, No.4, 2021.
Our central findings are twofold. 
First, the Chinese public in the COVID-19 era holds conspicuously optimistic beliefs about the growth of China's relative power vis-&agrave;-vis the United States: 
over half the respondents surveyed expect China to catch up with or surpass the United States in terms of relative power sometime during the next decade, 
and about 17 percent believe that this has already happened. This optimism corresponds remarkably well with the widespread perception that the COVID-19 pandemic 
is accelerating China's rise as a global power. Second, there are strong reasons to believe that "COVID-19 optimism" is fueling increased support for hawkish 
foreign policies among large segments of the Chinese public. The more strongly respondents believe that COVID-19 is hastening the growth of China's relative power,
the more they are likely to support the use of force against the United States and its allies, as well as supplanting U.S. dominance in the Asia-Pacific. 
Importantly, however, there is some evidence that this is a qualified hawkishness. Detailed analysis of the policy rationales offered by many of our respondents 
indicate that public support for the use of force against the United States tends to be premised on a situation in which China is being coerced or aggressed upon first.
