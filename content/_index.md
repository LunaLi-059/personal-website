alt="Picture of me" >}} Welcome! I am Sichen Li, currently a Ph.D. candidate in political science at UC San Diego. 
My research explores the connection between globalization and national security, using a multi-method approach 
that integrates network analysis, text analysis, case studies, and field interviews.

My dissertation investigates how geopolitical competition reshapes governments' role in the making of trade and
investment policies, changing them from advocates of economic openness into active generators of anti-globalization 
policies. The first part of my dissertation explores why governments are increasingly connecting trade and 
investment issues with national security. The second part examines how technological competition prevents 
governments from negotiating bilateral settlements to trade disputes.

I hold an M.A. in Political Science from Duke University and a LL.B. in International Politics from 
China University of Political Science and Law.
